# Third project

The third project will use parts of the second project to build the website and have it up and running. It will have different parts and will be basically a system where you can go with an NFC phone and make a Raspberry Pi read the temperature sensor, after that, save it to the database and send a notification with a command to say it loud from the command line.

##### Parts of it

- Database storing the temperature, when was it read and the change of temperature. Also one to store Users.
- NFC and Temperature sensors that will have their own class each.
- Notifications, fully configurable to add more if needed.
- Try to add some tests for it.
