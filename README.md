# Python

Some Python experiments

### First project

The first project is basically two kinds of socket servers that talk to a client requesting different information.

### Second project

The second project is a more complete server, it consists with a base page and different subpages, one to insert a new user, another to show the users in the database and finally one to log in.

It contains different aspects of making a website in a couple of days, with some nice animations and CSS to make it come to life.

### Third project

The third project will use parts of the second project to build the website and have it up and running. It will have different parts and will be basically a system where you can go with an NFC phone and make a Raspberry Pi read the temperature sensor, after that, save it to the database and send a notification with a command to say it loud from the command line.

##### Parts of it

- Database storing the temperature, when was it read and the change of temperature. Also one to store Users.
- NFC and Temperature sensors that will have their own class each.
- Notifications, fully configurable to add more if needed.
- Some tests when it makes sense.

### Final project

![Third](https://github.com/RamonGilabert/Python/blob/master/Resources/final.png)

The final project consists basically in an app, a web service and what was the third project of basically an NFC sensor together with a DHT11 sensor that go together.

#### Parts of it

- NFC and Temperature sensors that have their own class.
- Notifications, fully configurable to add more if needed.
- Web service to provide users and sensors.
- Web app to display and edit those.
